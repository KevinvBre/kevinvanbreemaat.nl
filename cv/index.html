            <div>I've spent the last 8 years at DEPT Agency where I've done work for numerous clients. From household names to B2B corporations. It's a fantastic place to work.</br></br></div>

                <div><b>Client: Maandag®</b></div>

                <div>Local staffing company with world wide ambitions and in need of a localized .com website. My added value for this project was to make sure the brand new strategy was translated correctly in design. While keeping track of timelines, scope agreements, third party suppliers and client business requirements.</div>
              </li>

              <li>
                <div><b>Client: Flowtech (UK)</b></div>
                <div>2023</div>
                <div>Big B2B and B2C supplier of hydraulic parts. With a strict scope and unique but fun user needs. My task was to align with strategy on our focus and the tech team for refinements and clean tickets.</div>
              </li>

              <li>
                <div><b>Client: Jonsson Workwear (South Africa)</b></div>
                <div>2023</div>
                <div>Commerce project for B2B and a strong B2C target audience in bespoke and custom clothing. My focus was on my environment with basic commerce and custom B2B features to keep track of employees, giant orders and custom sets and outfits for teams.</div>
              </li>

              <li>
                <div><b>Client: Royal Dutch Gazelle</b></div>
                <div>2022 - 2023</div>
                <div>Makes and sells 275.000 bikes annually. Looking to boost sales in countries where they are not a household name. My responsibility was to define a story telling user journey based on a flexible layer of locally available bikes and how users actually decide on a model, range and color.</div>
              </li>

                <div>A DAO with investments in crypto assets used in games. Looking to enable gamers to use their assets required to play web3 games to 'mine' crypto currencies. My task was to design a B2C service and community to discover fun games to play, an academy to learn and teach about crypto, digital safety and practical guides and tools to keep track of your earnings and income. All of it based on a digital strategy that was just as volatile as the market.</div>
              </li>

                <div><b>Client: Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences</b></div>

                <div>
                  My task was to support them to create the best tool for students. From short term 'when and where is my next lesson' to long term 'how do I find and enroll in a minor'? All of it in a native app for a digitally spoiled target audience with apps like Facebook/Insta/TikTok as point of reference. I had the opportunity to join this project from the pitch, first MVP release, user insights and workshop sessions, research and validation of new features all the way to the feature packed beauty it is today.

                  </li>

                    <div>Design of a B2B sales platform for post cold calls to companies or local governments to invest in giant million euro projects. Who decides where housing will be built? What do they need from a website to consider that heating network? Was loads of fun to learn about this mystery of a process.</div>

                <div>2018 - 2021</div>
                <div>Local Dutch Insurance company with non profit motive. I designed all the ins and outs of the consumer app to declare that bill, keep track of your insurances and chat with the help desk. In close collaboration with the native development team and business owners. </div>

              <li>
                <div><b>Client: Eveon shipping container</b></div>
                <div>2021</div>
                <div>A B2B seller of 2nd hand shipping containers. My goal was to design my very first commerce platform based on standardized patterns and best practices in the industry to fit the strict timeline that was available.</div>

                <div>An iconic Dutch worldwide seller of dairy products under different brands, you'll know at least 2 or 3 of them.

                <div>A Dutch Amsterdam region drinking water company. With a top notch service only website and my environment. Spending less time on the website instead of more was our ambition. I am not going to say anything else. Just ask anyone living in Amsterdam what they think about Waternet.

                <div>A local Dutch bank. My goal was simple. Restructure the website and content on it. I pretty much suggested removing 80% of it, they liked it and even got an award for it.
                  </div>

                <div>At that point in time it was still an in house start-up of a local Dutch Bank. I was responsible for the flow to request a loan and provide all the required documents to do so based on business and fraud prevention criteria. This was my first real project and I was swimming in the deep part so I am still grateful for my DEPT colleagues to keep me from drowning.</div>
